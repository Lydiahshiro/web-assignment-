<h2>General anaesthesia rapid sequence induction</h2>

<p>Used for <strong>elective</strong> or emergency surgery in patients who are <i>either</i> not fasted <i>or</i> where there is a risk of aspiration of gastric contents. The airway is protected from aspiration by the application of cricoid pressure prior to rapid intubation using a depolarizing muscle relaxant. Thereafter, the anaesthetic technique is the same as an ETT with IPPV in the previous section.</p>

<h2>Basic principles in ASA 1/2 patient:</h2>                      
<ul>
<li>Pre-oxygenate the patient for 3 minutes</li>
<li>Attach basic monitoring (SpO2, ECG and NIBP)</li>
<li>Proper preparation</li> 
<li>tipping trolley</li> 
<li>Equipment checked</li>
<li>suction available</li>
</ul>

<section>
<h3>Induction</h3>
<ol>
<li>Intravenous anaesthetics.<br>(thiopental or propofol)</li>
<li>Suxamethonium to facilitate intubation with cricoid pressure applied by anaesthetic assistant to prevent aspiration</li>
<li>Oral intubation and confirmation of tube placement by visualization, auscultation and capnography</li>
<li>Release of cricoid pressure</li>
<li>Non-depolarizing muscle relaxant to maintain muscle relaxation</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<ol>
<li>Oxygen/air or oxygen/nitrous oxide plus volatile agent</li>
<li>Top up doses of muscle relaxant guided by neuromuscular monitoring
additional analgesia as required</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Emergence</h3>
<ol>
<li>100% oxygen</li>
<li>Turn off volatile or intravenous agent</li>
<li>Reverse neuromuscular block</li>
</section>
<section>
<p>Remove ETT when patient spontaneously breathing, regains airway reflexes and wakes up. It is recommended that this is performed with the patient in the left lateral position.</p>
